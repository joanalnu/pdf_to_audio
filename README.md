Hi!

This code converts PDF files into audible .mp3 audios.

This code required the installation of ```gTTS``` and ```PyPDF2```. I used the following versions for each :
| Library | Version Used       |
| ------- | ------------------ |  
| gTTS    | 2.5.0              |
| PyPDF2  | 3.0.1              |


This is a modification of this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TiffinTech/python-pdf-audio), which is explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXsdt6RMNfY)

The sample PDF file is from [here](https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf)

Regarding the output, this '.mp3' can be added to VLC and Apple Music apps, as well as for video editting, creating podcasts from scripts and much many applications.

We do not take responsibility of the use of this tool.

We recommend you to save and organize your files so that any output is loosen, we do not take resposibility for loosen information.

Happy hearing!
